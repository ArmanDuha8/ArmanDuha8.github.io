excerpt: 'The threshold displacement energy (Ed) is a fundamental parameter for understanding radiation damage in materials, yet its determination 
typically relies on costly experiments or computationally expensive simulations. In this work, we employ the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying 
Operator (SISSO) machine learning method to develop analytical models that predict (Ed) based on fundamental material properties. 
Our models achieve high accuracy for monoatomic materials, outperforming traditional empirical approaches. For polyatomic systems, we identify key challenges and 
highlight pathways for improvement with enhanced datasets. This study identifies cohesive energy and melting temperature as the dominant descriptors of (Ed), 
providing a predictive framework for radiation damage assessment in diverse materials.'

This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning, specifically the Sure Independence Screening and
Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) method, to develop analytical expressions for predicting threshold displacement
energy (Ed) values in materials. The models constructed
using SISSO outperform traditional approaches like that
used in Konobeyev et al. in terms of accuracy and
generalizability, leveraging fundamental material properties. These results provide a valuable tool for estimating
Ed in monoatomic materials, reducing the reliance on
complex experiments and simulations.<br>

For polyatomic materials, while the SISSO models
showed limited success due to the inherent complexity and diversity of the data, incorporating improved
datasets and additional features could enhance their predictive capability. The effective Ed formulations for complex materials were previously constrained by the availability of known monoatomic Ed values, considering our
monoatomic predictions, this method offers a more robust pragmatic path forward. This study emphasizes the
importance of cohesive energy and melting temperature
as key contributors to Ed. These parameters are strongly
related to the atomic bonding strength within the solidâ€™s
structure, reaffirming their role in defect formation dynamics.    <br>
Future work should focus on expanding datasets, exploring temperature dependence, and refining models to
capture the nuanced behavior of polyatomic materials
under varying conditions. This approach represents a
significant step toward efficient, data-driven prediction
of radiation damage parameters, facilitating advancements in materials science applications in nuclear energy,
aerospace, and other radiation-intense environments.
