excerpt: 'In this study, we explore the potential of Floquet-engineered power-law interacting spin-1/2 XXZ models for generating metrologically useful entanglement. By leveraging spatiotemporal control of interactions, we demonstrate Heisenberg-limited two-mode squeezing, surpassing traditional limits on sensitivity in quantum sensing. Using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA) for numerical simulations, our results reveal universal scaling laws that unlock new possibilities for quantum platforms featuring power-law interactions.'

Our work demonstrates the scalable and robust
generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezed
states separated in bilayers of power-law interacting quantum
spin models.    
This extends the feasibility of two-mode squeezing to
generic power-law models, making it accessible in a significantly larger number of experimental platforms. In particular,
we show that finite-range interactions (α = 1,2,3) can
achieve the same amount of entanglement and squeezing as
infinite-range interactions (α = 0).<br>

We further develop a Floquet protocol utilizing spatiotemporal control to engineer the spin-spin interactions. This has
a number of immediate benefits. It extends the applicability
of our results to models with Ising interactions in systems,
which may not naturally realize Heisenberg interactions. In
addition, the Floquet-engineered model achieves the optimal
Heisenberg scaling of the sensitivity, providing potentially
orders of magnitude improvements. Finally, it also allows one
to implement time reversal by reversing the interlayer spin-exchange interactions, which may be used for time-reversal
based metrological protocols.    <br>
This establishes spatiotemporally engineered interactions
adapted to the initial state and the desired dynamics as a viable
pathway to unlocking significant quantum advantage beyond
that present in naturally occurring interactions. It highlights
the great potential in making full use of the control inherent in
state-of-the-art current experimental platforms realizing fully
controllable quantum spin systems for entanglement generation and quantum sensing.
