In this study, the numerical simulation of a monolithic 2-terminal allperovskite tandem solar cell has been analyzed. The electron affinity of
the electron and hole transport layers, the cross-section of defects, and
the thickness of each component were varied using the SCAPS-1D solar
cell simulator to understand their effect on the PCE. The simulation of
the tandem device was done with the bottom subcell being illuminated
with the light filtered by the top subcell, thus ensuring a realistic anal­ysis. Given the current matching condition, our simulation results
showed that the JSC of the tandem device is limited by the JSC of the
bottom subcell. Thinning of the top subcell is necessary to match the
current across the device. While the JSC of the tandem device is smaller
than the currents of the optimized individual subcells, a high VOC of
2.63 V in the tandem device results in a significantly higher PCE of
30.85% compared to that of individual subcells. <br>
The optimal thickness of the subcells found was 1.6 μm and 983 nm.
The calculated PCE for those thicknesses will be higher than experi­
mental values, given that the calculations consider only the dominant
scattering channel, trap defects at the interface, and ignore scattering at
grain boundaries. However, if we reduce the thickness of both cells to be
below 1 μm, we still see a large PCE. For instance, when the thickness of
the FASnI3 is set to 1 μm, the current matching condition requires the
layer MAGeI3 to be 961 nm and the results we obtain are that the JSC is
14.6 mA/cm2, VOC is 2.63 V, FF is 80%, and PCE is reduced from the
optimal 30.85% to 30.73%. Overall, these results suggest that lead-free
perovskites can compete with lead-based devices in all-perovskite tan­
dem solar cells. Further improvement in the performance of the tandem
device can be achieved by utilizing a bottom subcell that can provide
higher JSC.
