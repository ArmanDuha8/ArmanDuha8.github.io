excerpt: 'This work investigates how scalar potential and mass disorder affect the transport properties of Dirac fermions in two-dimensional systems. Using a tight-binding lattice model and the Landauer formalism, we uncover a rich phase diagram encompassing insulating, metallic, and scale-invariant behaviors. These findings illuminate the interplay between disorder types and their critical thresholds, offering insights into designing systems like bilayer graphene with tunable transport properties.'

In this paper, we have studied the transport properties of a
massive Dirac fermion in the simultaneous presence of scalar
potential disorder 1V and mass disorder 1M. Our numerical
calculations use the real space tight-binding model on a lattice
with on-site uncorrelated disorder developed by Tworzydło
et at. We study three different average masses, M¯ ,
which is interpreted as the band gap. In all three cases, despite
the band gap, we identify that a critical 1V ∗(M¯ ) exists above
which the system can no longer be an insulator for any 1M.
The results support the idea of band gap suppression by onsite Coulomb potential. For 1V < 1V ∗, the system can be in an
insulating or metallic phase, depending on the 1M value. As
1M increases, the system exhibits an insulator-to-metal transition at a critical value 1M∗(M¯ , 1V ). We have numerically
estimated the critical values, 1V ∗, and 1M∗, for different
M¯ values. Our work demonstrates the interdependent way
different types of disorders can affect the phases accessible
to a massive Dirac fermion system.
