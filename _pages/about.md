I am a computational condensed matter and AMO physicist with a passion for exploring quantum many-body dynamics, quantum simulation, and topological materials. My research focuses on advancing quantum technologies through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, leveraging cutting-edge computational tools to tackle complex problems in quantum transport, entanglement generation, and material optimization.
Currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Physics at Oklahoma State University, I aim to bridge theory and experiment to unlock new possibilities in quantum sensing, information, and materials science.

Research Interests
======
- **Quantum Many-Body Dynamics:** Studying out-of-equilibrium phases, entanglement generation, and quantum-enhanced sensing.
- **Quantum Simulation:** Leveraging ultra-cold atoms and Floquet-engineered spin systems for innovative quantum platforms.
- **Topological Materials:** Exploring transport phenomena in 2D materials, novel phases of matter, and quantum computing.
- **Material Optimization:** Performing first-principles calculations, DFT molecular dynamics for renewable energy sources.

### Power-Law Interacting Spin Models
Demonstrated Heisenberg-limited entanglement generation in spin-1/2 XXZ models using Floquet engineering.

  Our work demonstrates the scalable and robust
  generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezed
  states separated in bilayers of power-law interacting quantum
  spin models.  
  
  This extends the feasibility of two-mode squeezing to
  generic power-law models, making it accessible in a significantly larger number of experimental platforms. In particular,
  we show that finite-range interactions (α = 1,2,3) can
  achieve the same amount of entanglement and squeezing as
  infinite-range interactions (α = 0).  
  
  We further develop a Floquet protocol utilizing spatiotemporal control to engineer the spin-spin interactions. This has
  a number of immediate benefits. It extends the applicability
  of our results to models with Ising interactions in systems,
  which may not naturally realize Heisenberg interactions. In
  addition, the Floquet-engineered model achieves the optimal
  Heisenberg scaling of the sensitivity, providing potentially
  orders of magnitude improvements. Finally, it also allows one
  to implement time reversal by reversing the interlayer spin-exchange interactions, which may be used for time-reversal
  based metrological protocols.  
  
  This establishes spatiotemporally engineered interactions
  adapted to the initial state and the desired dynamics as a viable
  pathway to unlocking significant quantum advantage beyond
  that present in naturally occurring interactions. It highlights
  the great potential in making full use of the control inherent in
  state-of-the-art current experimental platforms realizing fully
  controllable quantum spin systems for entanglement generation and quantum sensing.

Create content & metadata
------

I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my expertise in quantum physics and computational techniques in academia, national labs, or industry settings. If you're interested in collaboration or have opportunities that align with my background, feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
