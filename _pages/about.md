I am a computational condensed matter and AMO physicist with a passion for exploring quantum many-body dynamics, quantum simulation, and topological materials. My research focuses on advancing quantum technologies through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, leveraging cutting-edge computational tools to tackle complex problems in quantum transport, entanglement generation, and material optimization.
Currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Physics at Oklahoma State University, I aim to bridge theory and experiment to unlock new possibilities in quantum sensing, information, and materials science.

### Power-Law Interacting Spin Models
Heisenberg-limited entanglement generation in spin-1/2 XXZ models using Floquet engineering for quantum-enhanced sensing.

  Our work demonstrates the scalable and robust
  generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezed
  states separated in bilayers of power-law interacting quantum
  spin models.    
  This extends the feasibility of two-mode squeezing to
  generic power-law models, making it accessible in a significantly larger number of experimental platforms. In particular,
  we show that finite-range interactions (α = 1,2,3) can
  achieve the same amount of entanglement and squeezing as
  infinite-range interactions (α = 0).<br>
  \
  We further develop a Floquet protocol utilizing spatiotemporal control to engineer the spin-spin interactions. This has
  a number of immediate benefits. It extends the applicability
  of our results to models with Ising interactions in systems,
  which may not naturally realize Heisenberg interactions. In
  addition, the Floquet-engineered model achieves the optimal
  Heisenberg scaling of the sensitivity, providing potentially
  orders of magnitude improvements. Finally, it also allows one<br>
  to implement time reversal by reversing the interlayer spin-exchange interactions, which may be used for time-reversal
  based metrological protocols.    \
  This establishes spatiotemporally engineered interactions
  adapted to the initial state and the desired dynamics as a viable
  pathway to unlocking significant quantum advantage beyond
  that present in naturally occurring interactions. It highlights
  the great potential in making full use of the control inherent in
  state-of-the-art current experimental platforms realizing fully
  controllable quantum spin systems for entanglement generation and quantum sensing.

### Quantum Transport in Dirac Fermions
Phase transitions in topological material driven by scalar and mass disorder, uncovering rich transport behavior in 2D systems.  
<details>
  <summary>Read more</summary>
  
  In this paper, we have studied the transport properties of a
  massive Dirac fermion in the simultaneous presence of scalar
  potential disorder 1V and mass disorder 1M. Our numerical
  calculations use the real space tight-binding model on a lattice
  with on-site uncorrelated disorder developed by Tworzydło
  et at. We study three different average masses, M¯ ,
  which is interpreted as the band gap. In all three cases, despite
  the band gap, we identify that a critical 1V ∗(M¯ ) exists above
  which the system can no longer be an insulator for any 1M.
  The results support the idea of band gap suppression by onsite Coulomb potential. For 1V < 1V ∗, the system can be in an
  insulating or metallic phase, depending on the 1M value. As
  1M increases, the system exhibits an insulator-to-metal transition at a critical value 1M∗(M¯ , 1V ). We have numerically
  estimated the critical values, 1V ∗, and 1M∗, for different
  M¯ values. Our work demonstrates the interdependent way
  different types of disorders can affect the phases accessible
  to a massive Dirac fermion system.

### Lead-Free Perovskite Solar Cells
High-efficiency perovskite tandem solar cell, offering a sustainable alternative to lead-based designs.  
<details>
  In this study, the numerical simulation of a monolithic 2-terminal allperovskite tandem solar cell has been analyzed. The electron affinity of
  the electron and hole transport layers, the cross-section of defects, and
  the thickness of each component were varied using the SCAPS-1D solar
  cell simulator to understand their effect on the PCE. The simulation of
  the tandem device was done with the bottom subcell being illuminated
  with the light filtered by the top subcell, thus ensuring a realistic anal­ysis. Given the current matching condition, our simulation results
  showed that the JSC of the tandem device is limited by the JSC of the
  bottom subcell. Thinning of the top subcell is necessary to match the
  current across the device. While the JSC of the tandem device is smaller
  than the currents of the optimized individual subcells, a high VOC of
  2.63 V in the tandem device results in a significantly higher PCE of
  30.85% compared to that of individual subcells.   \ 
  The optimal thickness of the subcells found was 1.6 μm and 983 nm.
  The calculated PCE for those thicknesses will be higher than experi­
  mental values, given that the calculations consider only the dominant
  scattering channel, trap defects at the interface, and ignore scattering at
  grain boundaries. However, if we reduce the thickness of both cells to be
  below 1 μm, we still see a large PCE. For instance, when the thickness of
  the FASnI3 is set to 1 μm, the current matching condition requires the
  layer MAGeI3 to be 961 nm and the results we obtain are that the JSC is
  14.6 mA/cm2, VOC is 2.63 V, FF is 80%, and PCE is reduced from the
  optimal 30.85% to 30.73%. Overall, these results suggest that lead-free
  perovskites can compete with lead-based devices in all-perovskite tan­
  dem solar cells. Further improvement in the performance of the tandem
  device can be achieved by utilizing a bottom subcell that can provide
  higher JSC.
